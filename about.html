<body>
<p>I've been a bagel maker, a bakery manager, a graduate student, and a biostatistician. And now I'm a mom and student.</p>

<p>I've been interested in coding/programming for a while.</p>

<p>In graduate school, we were encouraged to create personal web sites for the Biostat division webpage. I loved it, even though it was pre-CSS and pretty ugly. For my master's paper, I learned Fortran so I could build a simulation of the dose escalation in a Phase I clinical trial. Then I learned how to use LaTeX to make my paper and all the equations look so beautiful. And of course I needed to analyze data, so I learned S+ and SAS.</p>

<p>When I worked as a biostatistician, the programming in SAS was what I loved the most about my job.</p>

<p>After staying home for many years to raise a family, I started to think about going back to work. I enrolled in online courses in programming (SAS and R) and biostatistics. I especially enjoyed my R course. It was challenging but gave me an incredible feeling of success when my code worked.</p>

<p>I began applying and interviewing for biostatistician positions. But with so much time away from my career, I felt I needed to do something large and formal in order to prove my proficiency. Something more than free online courses. I considered my options. When I realized that what really made me happiest was coding, I decided that's what I wanted to spend my time learning.</p>

<p>I did the pre-work for an in-person (Javascript) bootcamp, and even committed money but decided I needed the flexibility of an online bootcamp. I read as many reviews as I could find. There were so many variables to consider: What language should I learn? Was it important to video conference with a mentor every week? Did I learn best by watching videos or by reading? I had just finished the pre-work for one other online bootcamp when I found Flatiron School's online program, Learn. After completing Learn's Intro to Ruby course, I was hooked. I am about half-way through their curriculum now. It hasn't been easy, but I have learned so much! </p>
