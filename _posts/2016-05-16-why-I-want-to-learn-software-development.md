I have been a stay-at-home mom with three kids for 16 years. When my youngest child started school 4 years ago, I started to think about going back to work.

I have a masterâ€™s degree in Biostatistics and before kids, I worked as a biostatistician for a medical device company. So at first I thought it made the most sense to try to get back into biostatistics. I took some free online courses in biostatistics and R programming through Coursera. But I knew I was going to have to invest more time and some money in formal training in order to prove my proficiency with SAS (what industry statisticians use for data analysis). The gap in my resume was just too big; it was about 14 years at that point.

I started thinking about what I really wanted to do and what made me the most happy. The programming aspect of my job had always been my favorite part. I even enjoyed having to learn Fortran for my master's thesis paper. And the R class on Coursera reminded me of the great feeling you get when your code finally works. I realized that biostatistics didn't really excite me as much.

So if I was going to have to invest time and money, why not do something that got me excited? I started researching bootcamps and going through some tracks on Codecademy and Code School. There was a new in-person bootcamp in Minneapolis that accepted my application, but I realized I didn't have 60+ hours a week to devote to this. So I turned toward online bootcamps. And found Learn! 

There are many days I question what this 40-something mom is doing trying to become a software developer. But for the most part, I am just grateful that Learn exists and I get to spend my days learning software development.
