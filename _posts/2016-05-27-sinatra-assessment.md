I just finished my Sinatra assessment this past week. For this project in the Learn-Verified curriculum, we had to do the following:

<ul>
	<li>Build an MVC Sinatra application.</li>
	<li>Use ActiveRecored</li>
	<li>Use Multiple Models</li>
	<li>Use at least one has_many relationship.</li>
	<li>The app must have User accounts; only the user who created the content can modify the content.</li>
	<li>Models must have validations so that bad data isn't created.</li>
	<li>Validation failures must be shown to user with error messages.</li>
</ul>
