Happy Leap Day!! We get a whole extra day this year.

I'm spending it trying to create a CLI gem for my final Object Oriented Ruby project for Learn-Verified.

I decided to collect data about summer STEM camps for high school girls, since I was already googling around for my daughter.
Some of the websites are not that easy to scrape though. I want to get the date, and it's often buried in a paragraph about the 
summer camp. I'm trying gsub, but it's ugly and gross. I'm not sure what else to do.
