			<h1>CLI Gem</h1>
<p class="meta">01 Mar 2016</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>The final project for Object Oriented Ruby at Learn-Verified is to build a CLI Gem. I decided to build a gem that finds information 
about summer STEM camps for high school girls. I have a 15 (almost 16) year old daughter and she wants to go to some STEM camps
this summer, so I’ve already been googling around. I was hoping to find one website to scrape for all the information, but wasn’t
that lucky. I had already created a google document listing 7 camps that my daughter was interested in, so I ended up scraping the
websites for those 7 STEM camps.</p>

<p>Prior to starting the project, I watched the video walkthrough of building a CLI gem, and I ended up pretty closely following 
the pattern Avi used for the DailyDeal gem. I used ‘bundle gem girls_stem_camps’ to stub out the structure for me.</p>

<p>lib/girls_stem_camps.rb contains all the require statements for Nokogiri, open-uri and the other ruby files (camp.rb, cli.rb and 
version.rb)</p>

<p>bin/girls-stem-camps calls cli.rb</p>

<p>cli.rb puts the initial “Welcome”, lists the name and location of the 7 STEM camps (with a call to camp.rb which scrapes the camp
data), and asks the user for input</p>

<p>With that input, more information is given to the user about the camp. The user can then list the camps again, get more 
information about a specific camp, or exit.</p>

<p>This was a really fun project to do. The scraping was kind of ugly at times, because the information I needed (cost, for example) was often buried in a paragraph of text. But I liked it.</p>
